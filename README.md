Complete Recursive Account Hierarchy Balancing and Detail Retrieval Feature

- Implemented a recursive function to traverse account hierarchies, constructing full paths for each account and retrieving the balance for leaf accounts.
- Enhanced the function to handle nested account structures, ensuring all child accounts are processed correctly.
- Integrated the recursive function into an API endpoint, enabling clients to retrieve detailed account paths and balances for a specified top-level account.
- Implemented eager loading of nested children in the database query to ensure complete and accurate data retrieval.
- Added comprehensive error handling and null checks to ensure robustness and reliability of the function.
- Refined the path construction logic to maintain a consistent format for account numbers and paths.
- Included debug output during development to trace the recursive process and verify correct account processing.
- Finalized the API to return the expected output, matching the hierarchical structure of the accounts.
